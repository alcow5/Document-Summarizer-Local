**Privacy-Focused AI Document Summarizer**  
*Effective Date: January 1, 2024*  
*Last Updated: January 1, 2024*

## üîí Our Privacy Commitment

The Privacy-Focused AI Document Summarizer is built with **privacy by design**. We are committed to protecting your data and ensuring that your documents and personal information remain completely under your control.

## üè† 100% Local Processing

### What This Means
- **All document processing happens on your device** - your documents never leave your computer
- **No cloud services** - we don't use any external APIs for document analysis
- **No data transmission** - your content is never sent to our servers or any third-party services
- **Offline operation** - the application works completely offline (except for optional model updates)

### Your Documents Stay Private
- PDF and DOCX files are processed locally using your computer's resources
- Text extraction and AI summarization occur entirely on your device
- Generated summaries are stored only in your local encrypted database
- No copies of your documents or summaries are transmitted anywhere

## üóÑÔ∏è Local Data Storage

### What We Store Locally
We store the following data in an encrypted SQLite database on your device:

- **Document summaries** (not the original documents)
- **Document metadata** (filename, file size, processing date)
- **Application settings** and user preferences
- **Processing statistics** (for performance monitoring)

### What We Don't Store
- **Original document content** - documents are processed and discarded
- **Personal identifying information** - no names, emails, or personal data
- **User accounts** - no registration or login required
- **Usage analytics** - no tracking or analytics data collection

### Database Encryption
- Your local database is encrypted using industry-standard encryption
- You control the encryption key
- Without your key, the data is unreadable
- Optional: Use password-based encryption for additional security

## üîÑ Model Updates (Optional)

### How Model Updates Work
- We check for AI model updates from our servers or GitHub releases
- Only version information is transmitted (no personal data)

### What's Transmitted During Updates
- Current model version number
- Your operating system type (Windows/macOS)
- No personal information or document data

### No Tracking
